# CSC442

NOTE: Notebook updated for 5b is CSC_442_Team_Project_Data_Cleaning.ipynb
NOTE: Data dictionaries were made for our merged dataset as well as our stock market data because it did not originally have one. Both are included in this repo as PDFs. However there is an included dictionary on Kaggle where the global economic indicators dataset was found.

GitHub: Create a Github repository for the project share link with TA and instructor within the pdf as a clickable link. The contributions to the repository will be monitored to know contribution of the team. The Github should contain the python notebook, datasets, and the data dictionary, team meeting notes - as a link or as a filled document and any additional files are always welcomed.
Assignment: In at most one page, provide a link to the files, write a brief description of the data (not a formal statistical description)
About data:
Give credits: provide link of the source where was the data taken from and names of people or organization (if available) that collected the data, 
Context: Provide context as to why was it collected as specified by the source, and 
Who: Generally, when data is collected a part of the context also states, who was it collected from (people) or about the process that generated the data. Most of the times, this will be about the people who contributed the data.
Cleaning and Wrangling: Clearly summarize your current understanding of the data-wrangling, and clean the data. Describe steps.
Data Merging: Summarize data-merging issues (steps and challenges), both specifically targeting your data sets.  
Just one submission per team is enough. Please note that the only chance for the teammates of the submitter to get credit for this assignment is to make sure that the submission mentions their names and specifically states what their contributions have been reflected and this should be also reflected in Github. 
For the report, this might look like: Student 1: Selected the data; Student 2, Student 3: Cleaned the data... 
Submit as a PDF will all these responses.
