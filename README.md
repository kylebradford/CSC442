NOTE: Notebook updated for 5b is CSC_442_Team_Project_Data_Cleaning.ipynb
NOTE: Data dictionaries were made for our merged dataset as well as our stock market data because it did not originally have one. Both are included in this repo as PDFs. However there is an included dictionary on Kaggle where the global economic indicators dataset was found.
